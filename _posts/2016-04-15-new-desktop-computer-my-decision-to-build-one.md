Hello Follower!

Until now, I had a portable computer, a Macbook pro, and I was doing everything on it, browsing the web, reading, writing, watching videos, coding & compiling, gaming, etc...

But... Everything has one day a downside... üòï I took my Macbook pro, mainly for my professional use, I need to be able to make Softwares for Macs, and of course, since the apple world was pretty closed so far, if you want to make apps for Macs, you need to make it on a mac... Otherwise, you have to use some underground Softwares which I am not really okay with....

Anyway, like I said, I am using my laptop for everything.. So... of course, I had to install Windows on Bootcamp (which allows me to have a dual boot, two Operating Systems working on the same machine). So, in my experience, Bootcamp is fine, but... It's pretty bad for other some things... To make it short, Bootcamp has to be used only for installing Softwares that cannot run on Mac OS and use Windows' partition only to run those programs. And we should not use Windows as the main OS.

What happened to me is that I used Windows' partition mainly for video games (I wasn't playing often, but during my vacations I started to play more often), and some day, windows (10), killed my SSD (hard drive).

**Wait what?!? How ? üòê**

To be honest, I still don't know. One day, my Mac partition refused to boot after a gaming session, my loading screen was just frozen... I tried a lot of solutions, none of them worked. The OS wasn't able to mount and load drivers because of a bad chunk allocation of my SSD drive. It means that some data that was supposed to be at a specific location wasn't there. So I had to restore my computer. And reinstall windows of course... üòë

In 2 weeks, I had a total of 3 failures of my SSD. At the 3rd failure, my Macbook wasn't restorable anymore... The SSD had a material damage on it... I brought it to the Apple Store, and today it is for 3 weeks that I have no news about it... They are still fixing it I guess... (I should call them this week üòÖ)

So, there is my story about how I am without my laptop and why I want a desktop Windows computer. I want to stop using my laptop for everything. Instead, I want a computer at home, which would be used for everything link to my home comfort and the need for a powerful machine for my work (Programmation), and gaming (I really enjoy playing video games \[when I have the time, which I don't have at the moment üò¢\]).

There we go. I made my decision. I will build a Desktop Computer!

But I am also a bit on a budget. üòî So I won't buy the computer at once, but instead I will buy each part and take my take to put them together. I am planning at the moment that I will be finished in May 2016\.

Anyway, I will post the progression as soon as I receive the pieces. And show the result! üòç

See you soon!
