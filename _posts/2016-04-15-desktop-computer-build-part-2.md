Hey, Followers! Long time no see! Sorry, I had a lot of work... That's the a lame excuse but I don't have another right now. Will think of a good one for the next time! ðŸ™‚

Anyway, to jump right into the subject. I will write today about the power supply I took for my build. I received it the 5th November in fact, made the unboxing pictures and then promise myself to make a post as fast as I can. So... Of course, I made it today...

Oh well, so... subject, focus...

After the tower, I had to estimate the power that my computer would need. I was expecting for at least an ATX-E motherboard, an X99 processor (LGA 2011-3), and some DDR4-3400\. All this in an Overclock (OC) non-human mixture, why not, right? And of course, I didn't want to be limited by my power supply. ðŸ˜‰

I start looking around on the web to see if I could find something similar to my target. I found a particular [website][0] which lists a lot of builds made by users themselves. And show the part they are using in they build, and why they are using them. Now, to be honest, I quickly lost track of what I was looking for, and could go further with my research here... It was super interesting indeed, but too much information kill the information in this case... ðŸ˜ž Then I went looking on forums, but finally, I decided to try to figure it out myself. 

So, I found an interesting [Power Supply Calculator][1] which in basic mode, don't ask much and helps a lot to estimate the power we would need. On my case I used this [configuration][2] and the result power recommendation was 1079W. So at this point, I had to find a what power supplies are around there with more than 1100W. After reading some reviews, my trust went to company [Corsair][3].

The power supplies of Corsair meeting my requirements are:

[HX1200i][4] ATX Power Supply:

[AX1200i][5] Digital ATX Power Supply:

[AX1500i][6] Digital ATX Power Supply:

Well, to be honest, it was not that difficult to make a choice. The power estimation was almost 1100W, meaning that if I would like to add some overclocking and maybe other components, I would be screwed with the 100W the 1200W models were giving.

I took the AX1500i Digital ATX Power Supply. I cannot say that I don't think that it's a little overkill, but that's what I am looking to reach with this build anyway... Oh, and also, this model have a pretty neat features, more to the fact that it's an 80 plus Titanium category (which means less than 10% of energy loss), it's fully digital, and using the Corsair Link software gives a lot of control on the power supply from the Windows interface directly.

I received my package a few day after my order and did a photo unboxing right away. ðŸ‘€

And of course, I tested my newly received power supply with my [Dr.Power II][7] to be sure that no factory anomalies were present on my component. ðŸ˜–

I also made a quick video of my tower with the power supply installed and the **[Dr.Power II][7]**as the pseudo motherboard. I could play with the built-in fans this way. I was super excited to see my "empty" tower taking life.

Next chapter will be about the motherboard! And yes, I have it already... I have to make a post about it very soon, I promise! ðŸ˜‡

See you very soon!
