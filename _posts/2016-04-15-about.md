Bello! I have been the author of [MyNeotopia][0], for some time now, and I wanted to make a blog where I could share stuff that matters to me, in a more personal level... I think it's important for my readers and myself to not to mix my hobbies and my life goal.

So... There we go, I first made this section on [MyNeotopia][0] for stuff about me and my hobbies... But I noticed that the two worlds (hobbies and life goal) collided, and it was hard for the reader to differentiate them has I wished. It should have been more social, and hobbyist, and less serious like the main part of the website (MyNeotopia), which is talking about how I want to make a better world. So I decided to separate completely the themes.

As on MyNeotopia, I am showing here that am also someone that has hobbies, needs, and that tries to create a better world for my family, myself and the rest of the world.

**What can you expect to this in this new section?**

* _Technology: _I dream in technology, so... It will be present (a lot).
  * Computers
  * Robots
  * Flying stuff
  * Medicine
  * Science, etc...
* _Artificial Intelligence:_My current professional goal is to master the AI world.
* _Music:_ I love music, so be ready for posts talking about it 
* And much more! I like, read, and do a lot in these fields, so expect me to share a lot in these domains 

I hope you will enjoy this new section, maybe some new people will be interested only in this section? Who knows.. Anyway, thank you for following me and sharing with me your experience too It's really enlighting for me!

See you soon,

Best,

Romain

PS: Yes... I love penguins (maybe you should expect something about them)
