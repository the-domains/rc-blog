Bello Followers! For some weeks now, I have been planning to build a Computer. I had to think about a lot about the configuration and the design. It ended up that I will take my time for building it because I won't have much time to use it anyway until the end of my studies.

After a lot of hours of research and talking with my friends, I finally decided for the tower.

I was mixed between **5 models**. I knew that I needed a tower that could handle an ATX or/and an **E-ATX**.

[Cooler Master Storm Stryker][0]

[Level 10 GT Snow Edition by Thermaltake][1]

[Cooler Master HAF X][2]

[NZXT H440][3]

[In Win 904 Plus][4]

In the end, my love went mainly for **Level 10 GT Snow Edition by Thermaltake**, then I bought it on my favorite online reseller.

Then, big news, today I received a big package of **14 Kg**. ðŸ˜‡

You can find all the pictures of the unboxing in this album on Imgur: [Thermaltake Level 10 **Unboxing**][5]

I am looking next for a power supply. I did a lot of reading about them, and a recurring problem I found is that if the power supply as a factory problem, you can say goodbye to all your components... And the company won't refund you enough to buy back the component that melted... They will say that all material have a depreciation at the moment you unbox it... So... oops.. too bad. Take the money and go away....

So to avoid this problem I decided to buy at power supply tester. The one I found that looks the best is the [**Dr.Power II**][6] by Thermaltake. All the feedback I found about this tool is positive. So I bought it as an anticipation to a defectuous power supply. I just don't want to have a very bad experience for my first build... ðŸ˜‘

Anyway, I See you soon!

I will keep you updated!
