I received it the 5th November in fact, made the unboxing pictures and then promise myself to make a post as fast as I can. So... Of course, I made it today...</p><p>Oh well, so... subject, focus...</p><p>After the tower, I had to estimate the power that my computer would need. I was expecting for at least an ATX-E motherboard, an X99 processor (LGA 2011-3), and some DDR4-3400. All this in an Overclock (OC) non-human mixture, why not, right? And of course, I didn't want to be limited by my power supply. ðŸ˜‰</p><p>I start looking around on the web to seeÂ if I could find something similar to my target. I found a particularÂ <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/" data-mce-href="https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/">website</a>Â which lists a lot of builds made by users themselves. And show the part they are using in they build, and why they are using them. Now, to be honest, I quickly lost track of what I was looking for, and could go further with my research here... It was super interesting indeed, but too much information kill the information in this case... ðŸ˜ž Then I went looking on forums, but finally, I decided to try to figure it out myself.Â </p><p>So, I found an interestingÂ <a href="http://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator" data-mce-href="http://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator">Power Supply Calculator</a>Â which in basic mode, don't ask much and helps a lot to estimate the power we would need. On my case I used thisÂ <a href="http://outervision.com/b/HK7iri" data-mce-href="http://outervision.com/b/HK7iri">configuration</a>Â and the result power recommendation was 1079W. So at this point, I had to find a what power supplies are around there with more than 1100W. After reading some reviews, my trust went to companyÂ <a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/power-supply-units" data-mce-href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/power-supply-units">Corsair</a>.</p><p>The power supplies of Corsair meeting my requirements are:</p><p><a href="http://www.corsair.com/en/hxi-series-hx1200i-high-performance-atx-power-supply-1200-watt-80-plus-platinum-certified-psu">HX1200i</a> ATX Power Supply</p><p><a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/ax1200i-digital-atx-power-supply-1200-watt-80-plus-platinum-certified-fully-modular-psu" data-mce-href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/ax1200i-digital-atx-power-supply-1200-watt-80-plus-platinum-certified-fully-modular-psu">AX1200i</a>Â Digital ATX Power Supply</p><p><a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/ax1500i-digital-atx-power-supply-1500-watt-fully-modular-psu" data-mce-href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/ax1500i-digital-atx-power-supply-1500-watt-fully-modular-psu">AX1500i</a>Â Digital ATX Power Supply</p><p>Well, to be honest, it was not that difficult to make a choice. The power estimation was almost 1100W, meaning that if I would like to add some overclocking and maybe other components, I would be screwed with the 100W the 1200W models were giving.</p><p>I took the AX1500i Digital ATX Power Supply. I cannot say that I don't think that it's a little overkill, but that's what I am looking to reach with this build anyway... Oh, and also, this model have a pretty neat features, more to the fact that it's an 80 plus Titanium category (which means less than 10% of energy loss), it's fully digital, and using the Corsair Link software gives a lot of control on the power supply from the Windows interface directly.</p><p>I received my package a few day after my order and did a photo unboxing right away. ðŸ‘€</p><p>And of course, I tested my newly receivedÂ power supplyÂ with myÂ <a href="http://www.thermaltake.com/products-model.aspx?id=C_00001777" data-mce-href="http://www.thermaltake.com/products-model.aspx?id=C_00001777">Dr.Power II</a>Â  to be sure that no factory anomaliesÂ were present on my component. ðŸ˜–</p><p>I also made a quick video of my tower with the power supply installed and theÂ <strong><a href="http://www.thermaltake.com/products-model.aspx?id=C_00001777">Dr.Power II</a></strong>as the pseudo motherboard. I could play with the built-in fans this way.Â I was super excited to see my "empty" tower taking life.Â </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7tuJX7l8LI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7tuJX7l8LI</a></p><p>Next chapter will be about the motherboard!

I have to make a post about it very soon, I promise! ðŸ˜‡</p><p>See you very soon!</p><p>Romain</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30">Desktop Computer Build â€“ PART 2</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
